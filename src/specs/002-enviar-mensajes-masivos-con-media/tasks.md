# Tasks: Envío de Mensajes Masivos con Contenido Multimedia

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-enviar-mensajes-masivos-con-media/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.5: Bulk Messaging Core Logic Tasks
- [X] T011 Modify `F:\developer\MariaDono\MarIADono3\src\bulk\bulkMessageManager.js` to orchestrate the sending of multimedia messages, including preparing data for `messageSender.js`.
- [X] T012 Modify `F:\developer\MariaDono\MarIADono3\src\bulk\messageSender.js` to send messages containing multimedia files via the WhatsApp bot API.

## Dependencies
- T011, T012 (Bulk Messaging Core Logic Tasks) before T017 (Testing Tasks).

## Parallel Example
```
# No parallel tasks in this reduced set.
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
